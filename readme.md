# VIM Finder

This plugin allows you to search for text in files in VIM.

```
:FindInPath {path} {search}
```

The `path` is relative to your current working directory if not absolute.

### NERDTree Integration

If you're using NERDTree, you can move the cursor over the directory you'd like to search and then press `m`
to bring up the menu, `f` to search that directory, and then enter the pattern you'd like to search for.
